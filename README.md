# CarAccidentSeverityML
According to the CDC, one of the leading causes of fatality in the United States is due to car accidents. In fact, in 2020 there were over 35,000 deaths as a result of car accidents in the United States. Moreover, there were over 1,500,000 people who suffered injuries, and over 3,000,000 people who suffered damage of property. Likewise, car accidents usually cause major traffic delays. These delays can not only be a health hazard for people requiring medical attention, but they can also decrease the overall productivity of Americans in getting to work and doing other societal tasks. There is no doubt that car accidents play a major role in the overall safety and welfare of citizens in the U.S.. Because of this, our group is motivated to tackle some key problems regarding this troubling statistics. What conditions play a major role in the severity of car accidents? From weather to the type of roads severe accidents occur on, we want to address the predictive capability of certain conditions against the severity of a car accident. By understanding what conditions pertain to the severity of a car accident, we can take steps to ensure safe driving that increases the health and welfare of Americans.
