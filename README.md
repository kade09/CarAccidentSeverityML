# CarAccidentSeverityML
The primary objective of this project was to explore the relationship between weather and other traffic conditions on the severity of car accidents within the United States. Our team meticulously examined a substantial dataset comprising 7.7 million accident records from sources including U.S. Federal and State Departments of Transportation, conducting essential tasks such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and in-depth statistical examination. Upon revealing the statistical relationship between features like weather on car accident severity, we employed the machine learning algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC), the team developed classification models that could anticipate accident severity based on prevailing weather conditions. Rigorous assessments involving performance metrics and cross-validation techniques were employed to gauge the models' effectiveness. The outcomes of the analysis conclusively established that weather conditions exert a substantial influence on the severity of accidents. Likewise, through our extensive model selection procedures, our best model had a classification success rate of over 90%. 

Format: Python notebook. Used Python for general coding. Pandas, statsmodels, NumPy, scikit-learn packages/libraries for data cleaning, preprocessing, and ML/Data analysis. Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
